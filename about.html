      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>In 2002, Thunder Ridge Ampride began as a single local stop for fuel and everyday essentials. Built on respect, hard work, and a strong connection to the community, we’ve grown — not just in size, but in spirit.</p>

      <p>Today, we’re proud to operate five unique locations across Cedar Falls and Waterloo. Though each store has its own name and flavor, they all share the same commitment: to serve with kindness, keep things honest, and be a place our neighbors can count on — day or night.</p>

      <h2>Why We Do What We Do</h2>
      <p>We know that what we offer is more than just gas or groceries — it’s convenience in your busy life, a friendly face during your commute, and a safe stop on the road home.</p>

      <p>Every customer matters to us. Whether you’re fueling up on your way to work, grabbing snacks for the road, or just popping in for a chat — you’re not just a visitor. You’re part of the community we serve and love.</p>

      <h2>Our Promise</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Treat every person with dignity and respect</li>
        <li>✅ Keep our stores clean, safe, and welcoming</li>
        <li>✅ Support local jobs and local pride</li>
        <li>✅ Show up every day — rain or shine</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We’re more than a gas station. We’re a reflection of the people who walk through our doors. And after 20+ years, we’re just getting started.</p>
